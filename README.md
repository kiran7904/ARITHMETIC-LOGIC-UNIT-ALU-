Description:
In this task, I'm designed a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which is one of the key components of a processor. The ALU performs basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, as well as logic operations like AND, OR, and NOT. The design takes two 4-bit inputs and processes them based on a control signal that selects the operation. i've already simulated the code and uploaded the simulation please go through it
